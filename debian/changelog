gi-docgen (2021.8+ds1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control.in: Adjust Description.
    The Description assumed that all packages that depend on gi-docgen will
    vendor a copy, but libportal does not (which will have a higher
    regression risk until gi-docgen is stable).
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (no changes required)
  * Upload to unstable, required for libportal 0.5 transition (#1003085)
